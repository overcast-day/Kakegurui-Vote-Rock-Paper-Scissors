Game Description and Rules
-----------
2 player game where players start with points and bet them while playing Rock, Paper, Scissor with the hand of cards they hold. 

*Note: The game was designed to be played on one moniter, so set up a divider in the middle of the screen before playing.*

1. Players make bets.
2. After betting, each player receives the same number of cards, for which they can decide the amount of rocks, papers and scissors to place into the shared card pool.
3. Each player is then randomly dealt 3 cards from the pool and will choose to play one of them. The rounds continue until one side wins or both run out of cards.
4. Betting and play continues until the other side has no points left.
